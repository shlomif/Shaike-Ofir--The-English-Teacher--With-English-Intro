This is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaike_Ophir[Shaike Ophir]'s "The English Teacher" Skit, only with an English introduction (as recorded by simcop2387)
instead of the original one in Hebrew. This was done to both avoid issues while playing it in an environment that is hostile
towards [Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Hebrew) and to making the skit more accessible.
